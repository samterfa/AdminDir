\arguments{
\item{customerId}{The unique ID for the customer's Google Workspace account. As an account administrator, you can also use the \code{my_customer} alias to represent your account's \code{customerId}. The \code{customerId} is also returned as part of the \href{/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/users}{Users resource}.}

\item{orgUnitPath}{The full parent path with the organizational unit's name associated with the device. Path names are case insensitive. If the parent organizational unit is the top-level organization, it is represented as a forward slash, \code{/}. This property can be \href{/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/manage-chrome-devices#update_chrome_device}{updated} using the API. For more information about how to create an organizational structure for your device, see the \href{https://support.google.com/a/answer/182433}{administration help center}.}

\item{screenshotFiles}{List of screenshot files to download. Type is always "SCREENSHOT_FILE". (Read-only)}

\item{recentUsers}{List of recent device users, in descending order, by last login time.}

\item{lastEnrollmentTime}{Date and time the device was last enrolled (Read-only)}

\item{firmwareVersion}{The Chrome device's firmware version.}

\item{macAddress}{The device's wireless MAC address. If the device does not have this information, it is not included in the response.}

\item{ethernetMacAddress0}{(Read-only) MAC address used by the Chromebookâ€™s internal ethernet port, and for onboard network (ethernet) interface. The format is twelve (12) hexadecimal digits without any delimiter (uppercase letters). This is only relevant for some devices.}

\item{serialNumber}{The Chrome device serial number entered when the device was enabled. This value is the same as the Admin console's \emph{Serial Number} in the \emph{Chrome OS Devices} tab.}

\item{diskVolumeReports}{Reports of disk space and other info about mounted/connected volumes.}

\item{status}{The status of the device.}

\item{systemRamFreeReports}{Reports of amounts of available RAM memory (Read-only)}

\item{etag}{ETag of the resource.}

\item{orderNumber}{The device's order number. Only devices directly purchased from Google have an order number.}

\item{kind}{The type of resource. For the Chromeosdevices resource, the value is \code{admin#directory#chromeosdevice}.}

\item{lastKnownNetwork}{Contains last known network (Read-only)}

\item{model}{The device's model information. If the device does not have this information, this property is not included in the response.}

\item{bootMode}{The boot mode for the device. The possible values are: * \code{Verified}: The device is running a valid version of the Chrome OS. * \code{Dev}: The devices's developer hardware switch is enabled.

\item{platformVersion}{The Chrome device's platform version.}

\item{autoUpdateExpiration}{(Read-only) The timestamp after which the device will stop receiving Chrome updates or support}

\item{dockMacAddress}{(Read-only) Built-in MAC address for the docking station that the device connected to. Factory sets Media access control address (MAC address) assigned for use by a dock. It is reserved specifically for MAC pass through device policy. The format is twelve (12) hexadecimal digits without any delimiter (uppercase letters). This is only relevant for some devices.}

\item{systemRamTotal}{Total RAM on the device \link{in bytes} (Read-only)}

\item{notes}{Notes about this device added by the administrator. This property can be \href{https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/1698333}{searched} with the \href{/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/chromeosdevices/list}{list} method's \code{query} parameter.
